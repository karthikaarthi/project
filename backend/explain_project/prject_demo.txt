    User Management: Role-based authentication (Admin, Student, Instructor).
    Course & Batch Management: Students enroll in courses & get assigned to batches.
    Attendance System: Instructors mark attendance, and absentees' parents get notified.
    Notification System: SMS/Email alerts for attendance and course updates.
    Security: JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)."**

Your Computer Teaching Institution Management System project is built using the following technologies:
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack Used
Frontend (User Interface)

âœ… Flutter (Dart) â€“ To build a cross-platform mobile app for students, staff, and admin.
Backend (Server & API)

âœ… Node.js (Express.js) â€“ Handles API requests, authentication, and database communication.
Database

âœ… MongoDB â€“ A NoSQL database for storing students, courses, batches, attendance, and user details.
Authentication & Security

âœ… JWT (JSON Web Token) â€“ For secure user authentication (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC).
âœ… bcrypt.js â€“ For password hashing.
Communication & Notifications

âœ… Nodemailer â€“ To send email notifications to parents and staff when students are absent.
âœ… Twilio (Optional) â€“ To send SMS notifications for important updates.
Middleware & Other Tools

âœ… Mongoose â€“ For MongoDB object modeling in Node.js.
âœ… dotenv â€“ For managing environment variables (e.g., database URL, JWT secret).
âœ… Postman â€“ To test API routes during development.
ðŸ”¹ Why These Technologies?

    Flutter: Supports Android & iOS with a single codebase.
    Node.js (Express.js): Handles scalable and fast backend operations.
    MongoDB: A flexible, schema-less database for managing large amounts of student and course data.
    JWT Authentication: Provides secure login and role-based access control.
    Notification System: Alerts parents and staff about attendance.

ðŸ’¡ Example: How These Technologies Work Together

    Flutter App â†’ Sends login request to Node.js API
    Node.js â†’ Verifies credentials using JWT & MongoDB
    User Access â†’ Based on role (Admin, Instructor, Student)
    Attendance Tracking â†’ Instructor marks attendance in the Flutter app
    Notification â†’ If a student is absent, Node.js sends an email/SMS
